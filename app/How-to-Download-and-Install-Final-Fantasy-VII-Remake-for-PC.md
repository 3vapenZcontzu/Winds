Final Fantasy VII Remake is not just a simple retelling of a classic story, but a bold and ambitious reimagining that expands and enriches the original in many ways. It adds new depth and dimension to the characters, the world, and the themes of the game, while also delivering a thrilling and satisfying combat system that blends action and strategy. It is a game that respects and honors its source material, but also dares to challenge and surprise fans with new twists and turns.
 
One of the most impressive aspects of Final Fantasy VII Remake is how it recreates the iconic city of Midgar with stunning detail and realism. The game takes you to familiar locations from the original, such as the slums of Sector 7, the Wall Market, and Shinra Headquarters, but also introduces new areas and secrets that flesh out the city's history and culture. The game also showcases the contrast between the upper and lower plates of Midgar, where the rich and powerful live in luxury while the poor and oppressed struggle to survive. The game does an excellent job of making you feel immersed in this dystopian metropolis, with its dynamic lighting, weather effects, environmental sounds, and lively NPCs.
 
Another highlight of Final Fantasy VII Remake is its combat system, which is a brilliant fusion of real-time action and tactical RPG elements. You can control one of three characters at a time, switching between them with a press of a button, while the others are controlled by AI. You can also issue commands to your allies using your ATB gauge, which fills up as you attack or take damage. The ATB gauge allows you to use special abilities, spells, or items that can turn the tide of battle. The combat system is fast-paced and fluid, but also requires you to think strategically and adapt to different situations. You have to exploit enemy weaknesses, stagger them with powerful attacks, use cover and dodge to avoid damage, and manage your resources wisely. The game also offers a variety of difficulty modes, including a Classic mode that lets you focus on issuing commands while your character automatically attacks.
