PSP VintageWarmer2 comes with three versions of the plug-in: PSP MicroWarmer, PSP VintageWarmer (LE) and PSP VintageWarmer2. PSP MicroWarmer is a simplified single-band version that offers low latency performance and low resource usage. PSP VintageWarmer (LE) is a direct descendant of the original PSP VintageWarmer with the same features and sound quality. PSP VintageWarmer2 is the most advanced version that includes the FAT (Frequency Authentication Technique) double sampling mode for even more accurate analog sounding processing.
 
PSP VintageWarmer2 features high quality signal processing algorithms that can be used for both soft-knee compression and brick-wall limiting. It also has a unique overload characteristic that can generate saturation effects typical of analog tape recorders. PSP VintageWarmer2 also incorporates professional VU and PPM metering together with accurate overload indicators to ensure professional quality results.
 
PSP VintageWarmer2 comes with a comprehensive library of presets that cover a wide range of applications and musical genres. You can also tweak the parameters to create your own custom settings and save them as user presets. PSP VintageWarmer2 is an essential tool for mixing and mastering engineers who want to add some analog flavor to their digital audio.
 
If you want to try PSP VintageWarmer2 for yourself, you can download a 30-day demo version from [the official website](https://www.pspaudioware.com/products/psp-vintagewarmer2). The full version costs $149 and can be purchased online. You can also check out some reviews and testimonials from users and professionals who have used PSP VintageWarmer2 on their projects.
  
## PSP VintageWarmer2: Tips and Tricks for Using the Plug-in
 
PSP VintageWarmer2 is a versatile plug-in that can be used for various purposes and genres. Here are some tips and tricks for getting the most out of it:
 
- Use PSP MicroWarmer on individual tracks to add some subtle warmth and glue without affecting the dynamics too much. You can also use it as a de-esser by setting the knee to hard and lowering the threshold.
- Use PSP VintageWarmer (LE) on busses or subgroups to add some color and cohesion to your mix. You can also use it as a parallel compressor by setting the mix knob to a lower value.
- Use PSP VintageWarmer2 on the master buss or on specific tracks that need some extra punch and saturation. You can also use it as a limiter by setting the ceiling to your desired level and increasing the speed and release.
- Use the FAT mode on PSP VintageWarmer2 to get a more analog and smooth sound. This mode uses double sampling to reduce aliasing and increase the harmonic content. However, it also increases the CPU usage and latency, so use it sparingly.
- Use the analog knob on PSP VintageWarmer2 to adjust the amount of noise and distortion added by the plug-in. You can also use it to emulate different types of analog devices by choosing different values.
- Use the knee knob on PSP VintageWarmer2 to adjust the shape of the compression curve. A soft knee will give you a more natural and transparent compression, while a hard knee will give you a more aggressive and punchy compression.
- Use the speed knob on PSP VintageWarmer2 to adjust the attack time of the compressor. A fast speed will give you more transient control and clarity, while a slow speed will give you more sustain and smoothness.
- Use the release knob on PSP VintageWarmer2 to adjust the release time of the compressor. A fast release will give you more punch and tightness, while a slow release will give you more warmth and smoothness.
- Use the release multiplier knob on PSP VintageWarmer2 to adjust the release time depending on the input level. A low multiplier will give you a more consistent and predictable release, while a high multiplier will give you a more adaptive and musical release.
- Use the semi-auto release mode on PSP VintageWarmer2 to let the plug-in automatically adjust the release time based on the input signal. This mode can help you achieve a more natural and transparent compression.
