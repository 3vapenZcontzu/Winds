In this article, we will show you how to use OmniRat to remotely control your Android device with Technic Launcher. This is a dangerous and illegal activity that can harm your device and compromise your privacy. We do not recommend or endorse this method and we are not responsible for any consequences. Proceed at your own risk.
 
## Step 1: Download and install OmniRat and Technic Launcher
 
You will need to download and install OmniRat and Technic Launcher on your computer. You can find the links below:
 
- [OmniRat](https://www.omniab.com/technology/omnirat/) [^4^]
- [Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/download) [^1^]

Follow the instructions on the websites to install them properly. You will also need to create an account for both OmniRat and Technic Platform.
 
## Step 2: Create a payload with OmniRat
 
A payload is a malicious file that you will send to your target device. It will allow you to connect to it remotely and control it with OmniRat. To create a payload, follow these steps:

1. Open OmniRat on your computer and log in with your account.
2. Click on the "Build" tab and select "Android" as the platform.
3. Enter a name for your payload and choose an icon for it. You can also bind it with another app to make it look more legitimate.
4. Enter the IP address and port number of your computer. This is where your payload will connect to.
5. Click on "Build" and wait for the payload to be generated.
6. Save the payload file somewhere on your computer.

## Step 3: Send the payload to your target device
 
You will need to send the payload file to your target device somehow. You can use email, social media, file sharing, or any other method that works for you. However, you will also need to convince your target to open the file and install it on their device. This may require some social engineering skills or deception.
 
Once your target opens the file and installs it on their device, they will not see any indication that they have been infected by OmniRat. The payload will run in the background and connect to your computer silently.
 
## Step 4: Control your target device with OmniRat
 
Now that you have infected your target device with OmniRat, you can control it from your computer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open OmniRat on your computer and log in with your account.
2. Click on the "Clients" tab and wait for your target device to appear on the list.
3. Select your target device and click on "Connect".
4. You will see a dashboard with various options to control your target device. You can access the camera, microphone, location, storage, SMS, call logs, contacts, browser history, and more. You can also execute shell commands, install and remove apps, and perform other malicious actions.
5. To use Technic Launcher with OmniRat, you will need to install it on your target device first. You can do this by clicking on "File Manager" and then "Upload". Browse for the Technic Launcher file 0f148eb4a0
